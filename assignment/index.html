            <li>I deleted this assignment from my entire computer to start over about four times. Learning to code is definitely a challegne. However, I love it. Yes, I got frustated. I was working on this assignment everyday, until my eyes could no longer see ðŸ¤£. Help was available. However, my determation wouldn't let me stop trying to figure it out and ask for help.</li>
            <li> I'm from Louisiana. Of course, my favorite food is seafood. Seafood boils are my favorite. There are
                several ways you can get them. My favorite is crawfish, shrimp, eggs, corn, potatoes, and sausage. You
                can add just about any seafood to the boil, not fish. I Love mines spicy. Have you ever heard the
                phrase, "If you're not sneezing, it's not seasoned"? Or have you ever ate something so spicy it made
                your nose run? Yes, that's how spicy it has to be. Non-seafood boils are also offered for those who
                don't like seafood. Available options for the non-seafood boil includes: corn, potatoes, eggs, sausage,
                turkey necks. I'm positive there are some more options. This list contains the popular items.</li>      
            <li>I'm a 90s baby! One thing i've taken from my childhood is, Cleaning with the music blasting. It brings
                me so much peace. A clean house, food, and a movie or music, is definitely my love language.</li>
